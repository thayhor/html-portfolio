<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in the 80s and never used a computer until early 2000s.
First computer training I had was how to use CorelDraw for graphics.
Ended up obtaining a diploma certificate in Graphic Design
</p>

<p>Studied Mechanical Engineering at the University and obtained a Bachelor of Technology but love for web design and computing never left.
Eventually started self-study on common languages then C, C++, Fotran.
Over the years, I've learnt other programming languages like Java, Python, etc. but not really used it for anything tangible
</p>

<p>First job was an auditor in one of the big 4 audit firms where I work as an IT Auditor. 
Looking back, I found my job rewarding and it's given me the opportunity to travel to 10 countries in the world and time to continue my learning in the world of programming and tech.
